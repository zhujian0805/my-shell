#  NAME:               FPA.ksh  
#                      The name is FPA.ksh the name of the FPA AUTOMATION 
#                      environment must be passed as the first parameter so 
#                      prevent multiple versions from running in the same 
#                      environment concurrently.  
#
#  DESCRIPTION:        Script to automate the processing of files.  This script
#                      is designed to be run periodically from a scheduler such
#                      as cron.  NOTE that the full path must be specified in the 
#                      scheduler and the parameter must also be specified. 
#
#                      The acronym FPA stands for File Processing Application.
#                      FPA.ksh searches certain directories specified by the
#                      environment variable FPA_SEARCH_PATH for all files of 
#                      type regular file.  For each regular file it finds in 
#                      any of the directories included in FPA_SEARCH_PATH, the 
#                      script attempts to match the filename against a set of 
#                      filename templates included in a file specified by the 
#                      environment variable FPA_FILE_TEMPLATES located in the
#                      directory specified by the environment variable
#                      BATCH_ETC.  An index number is retrieved from the 
#                      FPA_FILE_TEMPLATES file from the record for the first 
#                      filename template which matches the filename.  The
#                      script then uses the index to search a file of commands 
#                      to be executed.  The commands file is specified by
#                      the environment variable FPA_COMMANDS located in the
#                      directory specified by the environment variable BATCH_ETC.
#                      FPA.ksh then executes the commands associated with
#                      the index number.  The commands are executed 
#                      sequentially, and the success or failure of the commands
#                      are logged in the batch log for FPA.ksh.
#
#                      In the event that a file name matches multiple entries
#                      templates in FPA_FILE_TEMPLATES, only the commands for
#                      the first match will be executed.  
#
#                      Any regular files found in the FPA_SEARCH_PATH whose 
#                      names do not match any of the filename templates in
#                      FPA_FILE_TEMPLATES are moved to a directory specified
#                      by the environment variable FPA_UNIDENTIFIED.

#                      ~/.FPAprofile - the profile that FPA uses. Prevents the
#                          terminal commands in an interactive profile from 
#                          creating error messages in the cron logs.

#                          will cause the FPA to release itself after the

#                          beginning with "#NOTIFY_AFTER: YYYYMMDDHHMNS" will

#  ENV VARIABLES:      FPA_MAX_CYCLES - threshold for determining how long to

#                          run FPA.ksh) before initiating notification. 
#                      BATCH_ETC - the directory containing the FPA_FILE_TEMPLATES
#                          file and the FPA_COMMANDS file.
#                      FPA_CHECK_ENV - the file containing the list of scripts

#                          FPA processing.  If one of these checks fails, 
#                          FPA will issue a warning and exit without processing 
#                          files or jobs.  This file must live in the

#                          Each process listed in the file will issue all

#                          FPA_SEARCH_PATH.
#                      FPA_SEARCH_PATH - a colon-delimited list of directory
#                          names which this script will search for regular
#                          files to process by running the commmands in the
#                          file FPA_COMMANDS.
#                      BATCH_TMP - a directory the script uses to store a 
#                          lists of the regular files found in the directories
#                          of the FPA_SEARCH_PATH.
#                      FPA_SLEEP_TIME - time in seconds between the creation
#                          of the fpa_file_list.before file and the creation 
#                          of the fpa_file_list.after file.  These files are
#                          long listings of the regular files in the 
#                          FPA_SEARCH_PATH.
#                      FPA_UNIDENTIFIED - a directory to which files are moved
#                          if their filenames do not match any of the templates
#                          in FPA_FILE_TEMPLATES.
#                      BATCH_LOGS - a directory containing the log files for 
#                          production processes.  
#                      FPA_CONTROL_DIR - a directory where the 
#                          FPA_IS_SUSPENDED.DAT file must be created in order 
#                          to  suspend ALL FPA environment on this computer. 
#                      
#  INPUT:              FPA.ksh requires one command line argument indicating 
#                          name of the UNIX automation environment where it 
#                          is running.
#
#  OUTPUT:             FPA.ksh logs it's activity to the file FPA.ksh.log
#                      in the directory specified by the environment variable
#                      BATCH_LOGS.
#
#  TEMPORARY FILES:    fpa_file_list.before - this file is created by FPA.ksh and
#                          contains a long listing including the full path of 
#                          each regular file located in any of the directories
#                          of FPA_SEARCH_PATH.  This file is created for the 
#                          purpose of obtaining a "snapshot" of the state of 
#                          all of the regular files contained in the 
#                          FPA_SEARCH_PATH directories.  fpa_file_list.before
#                          is compared with fpa_file_list.after to ensure that 
#                          only static (i.e. non-growing) files are processed.  
#                          This file is located in the directory identified by 
#                          the environment variable BATCH_TMP.
#                      fpa_file_list.after - this file is a second "snapshot" 
#                          of the files in the FPA_SEARCH_PATH directories.
#                          fpa_file_list.after is a long listing of the files
#                          created a specified period after fpa_file_list.before
#                          and is used to ensure that only static files are 
#                          processed. 
#	               fpa_runs_since_successful.txt - this file contains a 
#                          counter of the number of times FPA.ksh has been
#                          started since the last successful completion of
#                          FPA.ksh along with each time that the FPA tried to 
#                          start and the PID.  This information is used to 
#                          send notification that FPA.ksh is hung after 
#                          a specified period.
